GO:0009653,anatomical structure morphogenesis,The process in which anatomical structures are generated and organized. Morphogenesis pertains to the creation of form.,BP,AREG,EGFR,hsa04010;hsa04012;hsa04151;hsa05210
GO:0048729,tissue morphogenesis,The process in which the anatomical structures of a tissue are generated and organized.,BP,AREG,EGFR,hsa04010;hsa04012;hsa04151;hsa05210
GO:0002009,morphogenesis of an epithelium,"The process in which the anatomical structures of epithelia are generated and organized. An epithelium consists of closely packed cells arranged in one or more layers, that covers the outer surfaces of the body or lines any internal cavity or tube.",BP,AREG,EGFR,hsa04010;hsa04012;hsa04151;hsa05210
GO:0035239,tube morphogenesis,"The process in which the anatomical structures of a tube are generated and organized. Epithelial and endothelial tubes transport gases, liquids and cells from one site to another and form the basic structure of many organs and tissues, with tube shape and organization varying from the single-celled excretory organ in Caenorhabditis elegans to the branching trees of the mammalian kidney and insect tracheal system.",BP,AREG,EGFR,hsa04010;hsa04012;hsa04151;hsa05210

GO:0048856,anatomical structure development,"The biological process whose specific outcome is the progression of an anatomical structure from an initial condition to its mature state. This process begins with the formation of the structure and ends with the mature structure, whatever form that may be including its natural destruction. An anatomical structure is any biological entity that occupies space and is distinguished from its surroundings. Anatomical structures can be macroscopic such as a carpel, or microscopic such as an acrosome.",BP,AREG,EGFR,hsa04010;hsa04012;hsa04151;hsa05210
GO:0050673,epithelial cell proliferation,"The multiplication or reproduction of epithelial cells, resulting in the expansion of a cell population. Epithelial cells make up the epithelium, the covering of internal and external surfaces of the body, including the lining of vessels and other small cavities. It consists of cells joined by small amounts of cementing substances.",BP,AREG,EGFR,hsa04010;hsa04012;hsa04151;hsa05210
